# telegram_bot_for_ERP
a telegram bot that enables fleet operation staffs to access ERP site for requesting vehicle related tasks.
This bot will help staffs to access and order requests in the go. 
In this bot I used telegram's python library(i.e. named telegram) for integrating the web automation with telegram.
I used asyncio library to run cocurrent processes in the telegram bot.(i.e. enables different users to use the bot)
for the web automation part selenium is used to automate chrome driver in headless mode and the file is named fuel.py.
